# <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

<p class="note">
On PCF for GCP deployments, Ops Manager service network VMs are not assigned the correct firewall rules. As a result, these VMs cannot communicate with the BOSH Director and service tiles that use the On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) fail to create service instances. As a workaround, if you are deploying a service network in GCP, modify your firewall to use subnet CIDR-based rules.

## <a id="new-features"></a>New Features

### Service Instance Lifecycle Errands

- A new errand can be specified in manifests that will delete all service instances and deregister the broker, called `delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker`
  - This will decrease uninstall times for tiles.
  - At the start of this new errand, service access is disabled so no more instances can be created.
  - Before this release, two separate errands had to be specified: `deregister-broker` and `delete-all-service-instances`.

### Other Enhancements

- Broker API supports custom response codes and error messages for create/update/bind/unbind/delete.

- The `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand now exits with a non-zero status code if upgrading any instances fails.
