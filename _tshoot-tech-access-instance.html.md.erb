1. To target an individual service instance deployment, retrieve the
the GUID of your service instance with the cf CLI command `cf service MY-SERVICE --guid`.

1. Pre-pend the text `service_instance-` to the GUID you just obtained to create the ID that BOSH uses for your service instance (e.g. if your GUID is `1Hy6H`, this becomes `service_instance-1Hy6H`).

1. Run `bosh download manifest service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID MY-SERVICE.yml` to download your BOSH manifest for the service.

1. Run `bosh deployment MY-SERVICE.yml to select the deployment`.

1. Run `bosh instances` to view VMs in the deployment.

1. Run `bosh ssh INSTANCE-ID` to SSH onto the VM.

1. Run `bosh logs INSTANCE-ID` to download instance logs.
