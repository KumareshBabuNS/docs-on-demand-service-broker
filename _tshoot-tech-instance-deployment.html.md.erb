1. Retrieve the GUID of your service instance with command `cf service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE --guid`.

1. Pre-pend the text `service_instance-` to the GUID you just obtained to create the ID that BOSH uses for your service instance (e.g. if your GUID is `1Hy6H`, this becomes `service_instance-1Hy6H`).

1. Run `bosh download manifest service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID myservice.yml` to download your BOSH manifest for the service.

1. Run `bosh deployment myservice.yml` to select the deployment.
